# Basic Sample Hardhat Project
We create simple exchange smart contract.

Ideal come from https://medium.com/coinmonks/programming-defi-uniswap-part-1-839ebe796c7b

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
